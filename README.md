## **b01lers Library**

# General Info
This repo is a library of all the (obtainable) challenges from each past CTF we've played, as well as writeups and solvers. We'd like to keep it organized, so one person per CTF will take the job of pulling all the challenges and putting them in the repo. The structure should be as follows:

# Structure

```
b01lers-libary/ (root dir)
b01lers-library/<YEAR>[ctf_name] (ctf_name should be lower-snake cased)
b01lers-library/<YEAR>[ctf_name]/<category>/ (category should be re/pwn/web/crypto/etc)
b01lers-library/<YEAR>[ctf_name]/<category>/<point_val>-<challenge_name>/ (challenge name should be the same as on the site)
```

# Contributing
If you want to contribute a writeup or solver for a challenge (or just fix something) you are welcome to make a pull request. Message us on discord as well if you want attention faster :)
