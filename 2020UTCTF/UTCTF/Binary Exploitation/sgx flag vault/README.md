## Description
>`nc sgx.utctf.live 9000`

The `sim_binary` directory contains a binary built for sgx-simulated mode. This can be run on any processor provided that the package `sgx-sdk` is installed.

The `hw_binary` directory will not work unless you have an sgx-capable cpu with `sgx-sdk`, `sgx-psw` and `sgx-drivers`.
