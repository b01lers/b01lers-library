While waiting for one of the speeches to start, a buddy of mine opened his laptop and typed in some lines of python.

'This is for you', he said. Turns out he likes to keep his code concise. I wonder what he will do when re-visiting the code in a couple of months or so. He did not even explain what this mess is all about and refuses to tell me anything further.

To mock me even more, my buddy put up the script on a server. I would like to impress him with a solution to this. It is a bit trickier than I thought, though. Can you give me a hand with this?
