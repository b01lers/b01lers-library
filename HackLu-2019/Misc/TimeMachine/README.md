Ey you, I found this time machine at the junkyard back in the abandoned town. Shall we take it for a spin? I have heared about this awesome event called Hack.lu, would be a good destination. They also have this flags you were searching for. Only one problem, I can't get that damn machine running. You help me start it and I help you get that flag. Sounds good?
