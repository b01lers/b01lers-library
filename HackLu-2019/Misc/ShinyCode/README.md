We got a video leaked of a new transmission technique working only with lights and colors. The company using it says it is completely secure because of its secret encoding. However, the whistleblower also says that the secret encoding is somehow encoded in the message itself. It uses an old, historical technique based on short and long signals. I have no fucking clue what he is talking about. Perhaps you can help us?
