Due to problems with our new website (the contractor did seem a bit shady) we had to hire a second contractor to fix the mess the first caused.

Bob is an amazing guy. He graduated college with 16 and has been programming for 20 years; the wet dream of every HR manager. We were so convinced, we had him start immediatly. But this time on our test server url. To prevent any unwanted access we secured it with basic authentication. The username is Dev and the password the sha512 hash of the flag from our live website. Please, since you already audited our live page, could you do so with the dev page, too?
