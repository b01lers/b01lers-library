We have 82 ones, so probably ASCII R. First one is unary R.
Second one binary decodes to I
Third one is trinary and decodes to capital T.
Fourth is actually binary, so square 4. 
Fifth is base 5, we get E.
Sixth is base 6, we get C.
Sevent is base 7, we get {
Eigth is base 2 again.
ninth is base 3, because it's a perfect square.
So we get to the end doing this, and we get 5 characters off or so, so we go back and change our rule.
Turns out that it's a set of all unique prime factors, ex 8 -> 2, 2, and 2, multiplied together. so 8->, 9=3, 18=3 * 2=6.
