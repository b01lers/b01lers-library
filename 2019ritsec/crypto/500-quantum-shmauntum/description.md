The flag for this challenge has encrypted (and base64'd) with the Quantum-Resistant Algorithm known as McEliece6960119. The McEliece6960119 system is used as a KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) in the Post-Quantum world. For this challenge, you must use the provided private key to decode and then decrypt the flag. Be sure to encode the flag as base64 when you go to submit!
