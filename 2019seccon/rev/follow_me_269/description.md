I have an execution trace of calc, but I forgot what I inputted. Can you submit the input (formula) which follows my execution trace to my server?

Challenge server

Server compares branch instructions' behavior of your input's and original execution traces, and gives you flag if these are the same.
NOTE: You MUST NOT attack challenge server (including too frequent access).

Sample curl command to submit formula: curl -q -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d "{\"input\": \"your formula comes here\"}" http://follow-me.chal.seccon.jp/submit/quals/0
Attached files

Executed binary (excluding dynamic libraries): calc
Execution trace generated by tracer: calc.trace
Source code of tracer developed on the top of Pin: branchtrace.cpp
